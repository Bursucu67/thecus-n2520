loop-AES-v1.0c    April 11 2001
    - First release to public.

loop-AES-v1.1b    April 16 2001
    - SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 hashes added.

loop-AES-v1.2d    May 7 2001
    - Newer AES cipher implementation from Dr Brian Gladman, with
      precomputed lookup tables and little speed improvement.
    - Support for old 2.0 kernels.
    - Makefile now runs "depmod -a" instead of "depmod" after installing
      loop.o driver.

loop-AES-v1.3b    June 27 2001
    - Mount and losetup programs now understand -p option to read password
      from file descriptor instead of terminal.
    - Cipher tests now integrated into Makefile.
    - Optional kernel 2.4 patch version included for those people who prefer
      not to use modules.
    - Data corrupting bug with LVM has been fixed (kernel 2.4 only). Thanks
      to David Dodge for this bugfix.

loop-AES-v1.3c    July 5 2001
    - loop.c-2.4.original updated to Linus' 2.4.6 version, and Makefile
      updated to compile that version on older kernels as well.

loop-AES-v1.3d    August 4 2001
    - loop.c-2.4.original updated to Alan Cox's 2.4.7-ac5 version (ext3
      changes), and Makefile updated to compile that version on older
      kernels as well.

loop-AES-v1.4d    September 3 2001
    - Little speed optimization in aes-glue.c
    - External encryption module locking bug is fixed (kernel 2.4 only).
      This bug did not affect loop-AES operation at all. This fix is from
      Ingo Rohloff.
    - On 2.4 kernels, device backed loop maintains private pre-allocated
      pool of RAM pages that are used when kernel is totally out of free
      RAM. This change also fixes stock loop.c sin of sleeping in
      make_request_fn().

loop-AES-v1.4e    September 29 2001
    - Execute depmod only if target was currently running kernel.
    - loop.c-2.4.original updated to Linus' 2.4.10 + fixes from 2.4.9-ac16,
      with ifdefs so it compiles on older kernels as well.
    - Rest of AES finalist cipher names added to util-linux patch.
    - External encryption module locking bug is fixed (kernel 2.2 only,
      backported kernel 2.4 fix). This bug did not affect loop-AES operation
      at all.
    - Password seeds can be used to slow down dictionary attacks. "-S XXX"
      option added to losetup, and "-o pseed=XXX" option added to mount.
    - For device backed loops, allocate pages only from private pool during
      run time (kernel 2.4 only). This eases stress on the VM as some of
      them can't handle stress too well.

loop-AES-v1.4f    October 27 2001
    - Use newly added KERNELRELEASE in kernel 2.0 modules install path.
    - build-initrd.sh shell script included to build /boot/initrd.gz that
      can be used when root partition is encrypted.
    - Default blocksize computation of file backed loop now shrinks
      blocksize only if necessary. Previous default was hardcoded 1024.
    - Add a workaround for 5 parameter do_generic_file_read()
    - loop.c-2.4.original updated to Alan Cox's 2.4.13-ac2, with ifdefs so
      it compiles on older kernels as well.

loop-AES-v1.4g    November 7 2001
    - Fix ancient loop bug that prevented rw losetuping/mounting device
      backed loop if looped to device node resided on ro mounted filesystem.
    - Remove old wrong loop.o automatically on 2.4 kernels.
    - Makefile now prints currently running kernel version and what kernel
      version module was compiled for.
    - Add a workaround for deactivate_page() that vanished in 2.4.14.
    - loop.c-2.4.original updated with fixes from 2.4.14.

    - Ugly macros cleaned from kernel-2.4.diff
    - Add conditional reschedule to NONE and XOR transfers.
    - build-initrd.sh modified to work with non-modular kernel.
    - Fixed kernel 2.4 file backed loop page alloc error handling bug.

    - Added second util-linux patch from Michael K. Johnson that adds -O
      option to mount and umount programs.
    - Added build-initrd.sh enhancements from Hauke Johannknecht.
    - Fixed ancient loop.c off-by-one bug in offset computation (2.2 and 2.0
      kernels only).
    - loop.c-2.4.original updated with fixes from 2.4.17.
    - Added optimized assembler implementation of AES cipher for Pentium or
      better x86 processors.

loop-AES-v1.5c    March 5 2002
    - build-initrd.sh now works with devfs and can setup national keyboard
      layout before asking password.
    - Added losetup -d and losetup -e to "make tests" between writing test
      file and reading test file. This is to prevent kernel from caching
      test data.
    - Added RIPE-MD160 hash, and "-H rmd160", "-I 123" options to losetup,
      and "-o phash=rmd160,loinit=123" options to mount.
    - loop.c-2.4.original updated with fixes from 2.4.19-pre2
    - Added workaround for missing current->nice in recent -ac kernels.

loop-AES-v1.6b    April 14 2002
    - Fixed xgetpass() realloc error case handling bug.
    - Fixed silly bug that enforced minimum password length if "-H rmd160"
      and "-S xxx" options were both used simultaneously.
    - Added -T option to losetup. -T asks password twice.
    - Added NONE, XOR and unhashed AES tests to "make tests" script.
    - Fixed NONE transfer remap optimization bug (2.4 and 2.5 kernels).
    - Changed loop_make_request() so that it may sleep (partially reverts
      loop-AES-v1.4d change to non-sleeping code).
    - Added support for 2.5 kernels. Large part of 2.4 buffer_head to 2.5
      bio porting work was done by Ben Slusky.
    - "swapon -a" and "swapoff -a" now understand loop=/dev/loop? and
      encryption=AES128 options in /etc/fstab for easier encrypted swap
      setup.
    - Make runs depmod with -F and -b options and kernel-version if they are
      needed and depmod understands them.
    - Merged build-initrd.sh additional loop module parameter and chdir("/")
      fixes from Andreas Voegele.
    - Added Dr Brian Gladman's copyright and terms to resulting object code
      so that binary distributions can avoid legal trouble.
    - Makefile updated to be compatible with Keith Owens' new kbuild.

loop-AES-v1.6c    May 9 2002
    - Fixed genuine loop bug that always exports loop sector size as 512
      bytes regardless of sector size of underlying device (2.4, 2.2 and 2.0
      kernels). Thanks to Peter Niemayer for reporting and testing this bug.
    - Merged build-initrd.sh /boot/grub/menu.lst comments and kernel halt
      changes from Jani Averbach.
    - Modified build-initrd.sh to ask password again if mount failed. Also
      added workarounds for misconfigured/buggy bootloaders.
    - Added -a option to losetup that shows status of all configured loop
      devices. Also fixed cosmetic bug that showed xor encryption as
      unknown.
    - Merged reparent_to_init() and set_current_state() fixes from
      2.4.19-pre7-ac3
    - Added workaround for 2.5 kernel block device module locking bug.
    - loop.c-2.5.original updated with fixes from 2.5.14

      releasing device (2.2 kernels).

loop-AES-v1.6d    May 30 2002
    - Fixed file backed loop bug that occasionally caused spurious I/O
      errors. Fix is based on Andrew Morton's idea. (2.4 and 2.5 kernels)
    - loop.c-2.5.original updated with fixes from 2.5.19
    - Makefile updated to work with 2.5.19 and later kernels.

loop-AES-v1.6e    June 17 2002
    - Added "-K xxx", "-G yyy" options to losetup and "-o gpgkey=xxx", "-o
      gpghome=yyy" options to mount that can be used to setup and mount loop
      devices with GnuPG encrypted loop key.
    - Removed build-gpgmount.sh because its functionality is now in mount
      and losetup programs.
    - Fixed file backed loop read error handling bug that only occured in
      hurt-me-plenty case where looped to file was truncated while it was
      being used (2.4 and 2.5 kernels).
    - Makefile updated to work with 2.5.22 and later kernels.
    - loop.c-2.5.original updated with fixes from 2.5.22

loop-AES-v1.6f    August 14 2002
    - Makefile updated to use CFLAGS_NOSTDINC with new kbuild.
    - swapon now adds -v1 option to mkswap execv()'s on 2.5 kernels.
    - Cosmetic fixups to some error case printk's in the loop driver.
    - Added /dev/hd[efgh] and /dev/sd[efgh] support to build-initrd.sh
    - Made build-initrd.sh work with GnuPG-key encrypted root partition.
    - "swapoff -a" of encrypted partitions now writes some collected random
      entropy to the partitions to be used on next "swapon -a"

    - Removed workaround for 2.5 kernel block device module locking bug.
    - Fixed loop.o to work correctly with CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND (2.4
      kernels).

loop-AES-v1.6g    September 28 2002
    - Removed unnecessary memcpy from file backed unencrypted loops (2.4 and
      2.5 kernels).
    - Dropped loop thread O(1) scheduler nice from -20 to -9 (2.4 and 2.5
      kernels). No change for kernels using old scheduler.
    - Fixed genuine loop bug that always exported loop sector size as 512
      bytes regardless of sector size of underlying device (bug affected
      only 2.5 kernels because other kernel versions were fixed earlier).
      Fix was copied from Adam J. Richter's loop fixes.
    - Fixed one file-backed-loop-on-tmpfs bug (2.5 kernels only). Fix from
      Adam J. Richter's loop fixes.
    - Fixed default soft block size computation with non-zero loop offset
      (2.4 and 2.5 kernels).
    - Merged two driver init time out-of-mem-handling bugfixes from
      2.4.20-pre7-ac1 (2.4 and 2.5 kernels)
    - loop.c-2.2.original updated with fixes from 2.2.22
    - Added support for CONFIG_LBD (2.5 kernels)
    - loop.c-2.5.original updated with fixes from 2.5.39

loop-AES-v1.6h    October 3 2002
    - Fixed file backed loop bug where loop thread incorrectly inherited
      maximum file size resource limit from mount process. This bug can
      cause data loss if user mounting file backed loop has maximum file
      size limit (ulimit -f) set smaller than size of loop file (2.4 and 2.5
      kernels).
    - loop.c-2.5.original updated with fixes from 2.5.40
    - Added workaround for loop.h breakage in 2.5.40

loop-AES-v1.6i    December 1 2002
    - Removed support for Keith Owens' unmaintained kbuild-2.5
    - Added loop device number to some error case printk's in the loop
      driver (2.4 and 2.5 kernels).
    - Makefile no longer attempts to use i586 assembler code on x86-64
    - Makefile now uses pre-patched loop code on 2.4 and later kernels.
    - loop.c-2.5.patched updated with fixes from 2.5.50
    - Makefile updated to work with 2.5.50
    - Added -F command line option to losetup. -F reads and uses loop
      related mount options from /etc/fstab
    - Module locking rewritten to support 2.5.48 and later kernels.
    - Second util-linux patch dropped because mainline mount/umount now
      understand -O option.
    - Fixed bug where running 'swapoff -a' twice returned error status. Bug
      fix from andras@chello.se

loop-AES-v1.7a    December 26 2002
    - Fixed bug where running 'swapon -a' in some encrypted swap error cases
      didn't correctly return error status.
    - Added "-C nnn" option to losetup and "-o itercountk=nnn" option to
      mount that iterate encryption key nnn thousand times through AES-256.
      Based on code from Sami Farin.
    - build-initrd.sh updated to understand losetup "-C nnn" option.
    - loop.c-2.5.patched updated with fixes from 2.5.53
    - Added workaround for signal locking changes in RedHat 8.1 beta kernel.

loop-AES-v1.7b    January 30 2003
    - Removed struct loop_device delayed allocation optimization from
      loop.c-2.5.patched because 2.5.58 needs a queue at add_disk() time.
    - Modified Makefile to link with init/vermagic.o on 2.5 kernels.
    - Added twofish160 encryption identifier to util-linux patch.
    - Fixed bug that caused processes to be stuck in 'D' state in some rare
      circumstances (2.4 and 2.5 kernels). This bug is present in loop-AES
      versions v1.6b to v1.7a. Special thanks to Zygo Blaxell for bug
      hunting and testing.

loop-AES-v1.7c    March 25 2003
    - Modified Makefile to link with new style version magic on 2.5 kernels.
    - Added workaround for signal locking changes in RedHat 9.0 beta kernel.
    - Updated GFP_* mask setting to modify inode->i_mapping->gfp_mask only
      for file backed loops (2.4 and 2.5 kernels).
    - loop.c-2.5.patched updated with fixes from 2.5.66

loop-AES-v1.7d    June 13 2003
    - Added kernel side support for struct loop_info64 (2.5 kernels).
    - loop.c-2.5.patched updated with fixes from 2.5.70-bk
    - Modified Makefile to use /sbin/ absolute path for depmod and losetup.
    - build-initrd.sh now supports /dev/md* and /dev/fd[01] devices
    - build-initrd.sh now supports GnuPG files on removable device
    - Added warning about unsupported devices to build-initrd.sh
    - Dropped loop thread O(1) scheduler nice from -9 to -1 (2.4 and 2.5
      kernels). No change for kernels using old scheduler.
    - Added lo_nice= module parameter for easier scheduler nice tuning (2.4
      and 2.5 kernels).
    - Added 'AES-unhashed' encryption type which can be used to access
      ancient loop-AES-v1.0c disk images. Unhashed encryption type 'AES'
      (without numbers) may eventually vanish because it conflicts with
      kerneli.org syntax.
    - Removed unused code from 'losetup -C' processing so that losetup and
      mount programs are now little bit smaller.

loop-AES-v1.7e    August 26 2003
    - Removed now unnecessary module locking hacks on 2.6 kernels.
    - loop.c-2.6.patched updated with fixes from 2.6.0-test4
    - loop.c-2.4.patched updated with ioctl fixes from 2.4.22 and
      2.4.20-SuSE-86 kernel.
    - Removed SEPARATEMODULEDIR setting from build-initrd.sh. Now /linuxrc
      loads modules from /boot/modules-KERNELRELEASE/ directory.
    - Swapon now skips first page of swap partitions when setting up
      encrypted swaps. This leaves unencrypted swap signature page
      untouched. Based on code from Yoav Weiss.

loop-AES-v2.0b    November 29 2003
    - Added workaround for module naming breakage in recent
      module-init-tools (2.6 kernels).
    - loop.c-2.6.patched updated with fixes from 2.6.0-test11
    - Added INITIALDELAY setting to build-initrd.sh. This delays /linuxrc
      mounts to be more compatible with slowly initializing devices. Code
      from Andreas Voegele.
    - Added support for struct loop_info64 (2.4 kernels).
    - Added support for removing offset from IV computations (2.4 and 2.6
      kernels).
    - Added -r option to losetup for read-only mode.
    - 64 bit loop device/file offset can now be used on 2.4 and later
      kernels.
    - Added 64 bit "-s nnn" option to losetup and "-o sizelimit=nnn" option
      to mount to limit size of loop device. This option works only on 2.4
      and later kernels.
    - Added support for MD5 IV computation and multi-key operation that
      reduce chances of identical ciphertexts and triggers change to all
      cipher blocks in 512 byte CBC chain if any bit is changed in the 512
      byte CBC chain. MD5 IV is only used in multi-key mode, read losetup -K
      man page for more details.
    - Unhashed encryption type, created using ancient loop-AES-v1.0c, now
      needs 'mount -o phash=unhashed1' or 'losetup -H unhashed1'.
    - Added support for separate object dir on 2.6.x kernels.
    - Eliminated highmem io buffer bouncing (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).
    - Added proper error handling to kernel_thread() error cases (2.4 and
      2.6 kernels).

loop-AES-v2.0c    December 18 2003
    - Fixed util-linux patch so it compiles on boxes where C library is
      compiled against 2.6 kernel headers.
    - Fixed SMP race that could corrupt data if all following conditions are
      met: (1) loop device is in multi-key mode, (2) SMP or UP+PREEMPT box,
      (3) shared writable mappings to a file, (4) memory mapped file data
      modified at same time as that same data is being encrypted inside loop
      transfer function, and (5) unclean shutdown so that re-dirtied page
      won't get written again.

loop-AES-v2.0d    December 19 2003
    - v2.0c SMP race fix created new race with small security hole on 2.2
      and 2.0 kernels when loop is in multi-key mode. That security hole is
      now fixed. No change at all for 2.4 and later kernels because they
      were not affected.

loop-AES-v2.0e    January 21 2004
    - Modified build-initrd.sh to make it work with Debian version of
      module-init-tools. Patch from Martin Godisch.
    - build-initrd.sh can now be configured to build linuxrc using dietlibc.
      Patch originally from Martin Godisch. Patch cleaned up by Jari Ruusu.
    - Tiny speed optimization in MD5 IV computation.
    - Added workaround for Makefile breakage in 2.6.1-mm5
    - Added workaround for CONFIG_REGPARM=y breakage.

loop-AES-v2.0f    February 9 2004
    - Modified build-initrd.sh so that initrd loads loop module using .ko
      extension on 2.6 kernels. Previous version always used .o extension.
    - Removed 2.6.1-mm5 Makefile breakage workaround.
    - Modified Pentium assembler implementation detection to work with new
      style CPU selection code that is present in some 2.6 kernels.
    - Changed some build-initrd.sh defaults. New defaults are: USEGPGKEY=1,
      USEPIVOT=1, and USEDIETLIBC=1
    - Updated loop code to be compatible with Pavel Machek's software
      suspend code (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).

loop-AES-v2.0g    March 15 2004
    - Fixed build-initrd.sh compile time incompatibility with Fedora Core1.
    - Added support for Axboe's per-backing dev unplugging (2.6 kernels).
    - Added kernel patch version for 2.6.4 kernel.

loop-AES-v2.1a    May 8 2004
    - Makefile updated to work with 2.6.6-rc3 kernel.
    - build-initrd.sh changed to consume 40 KB less kernel RAM when used
      with gpg encrypted key files. This change may break really old gpg
      versions that choke with read-only mounted keyrings.
    - Kernel patch versions now require removal of drivers/block/loop.c and
      include/linux/loop.h source files before patch can be applied.
    - Added back aes.c code that avoids byte swaps on big endian boxes. This
      change improves performance on all non-x86 computers.
    - Security fix: restrict length of passphrase to max 4094 bytes when it
      is read from file descriptor using "mount -p 0" option.
    - Added ioctl32 compatibility that is needed on 64bit boxes running
      32bit losetup/mount programs (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).
    - Fixed build-initrd.sh incompatibility with distros that have system
      libraries in /lib64 instead of /lib

loop-AES-v2.1b    May 27 2004
    - Makefile and loop updated to work with 2.6.7-rc1-mm1 kernel.
    - Fixed bio vec merge bug that only affected loop on top of md-raid0 or
      md-linear (2.6 kernels only).
    - Enabled support for 2.6 kernel bio write barriers using
      QUEUE_FLAG_ORDERED flag.

loop-AES-v2.1c    July 28 2004
    - Adapted and merged Russell King's loop.c flush_dcache_page() fix. Most
      sane processors were not affected, but some processors with goofy
      aliasing caches were indeed affected (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).
    - Added optimized assembler implementations of AES and MD5 functions for
      AMD64 and compatible processors.
    - Pentium-2 optimized assembler implementations of AES and MD5 are
      really i386 compatible, so now those assembler implementations are
      enabled for all x86 processors.
    - Fixed Makefile to be compatible with distros that include ""
      characters in KERNELRELEASE string.
    - Added dkms.conf configuration file for Dynamic Kernel Module Support.
      Charles Duffy wrote original version.
    - Added support for /lib/modules/`uname -r`/source symlink.
    - Converted MODULE_PARM macros to module_param (2.6 kernels only).
    - Added workaround for scripts/modpost breakage (2.6 kernels only).

loop-AES-v2.2a    September 8 2004
    - Fixed multi-key ioctl incompatibility with sparc64 boxes running 64
      bit kernel and 32 bit userland. Fix enabled for 2.4.26 and later 2.4
      kernels. 2.6 kernels were not affected.
    - Added key scrubbing support for AES loop cipher. This feature is not
      enabled by default because it doubles storage space requirement for
      loop encryption keys. To enable, add KEYSCRUB=y parameter to loop
      module make command. (2.4 and 2.6 kernels only).
    - Added multi-key compatibility to losetup and mount -p option handling.
    - Fixed incompatibility with 2.6.8.1 kernel struct bio handling.
    - Small optimization to bio I/O barrier support. Also added support for
      queue->issue_flush_fn() I/O barrier calls. (2.6 kernels only).
    - Added workaround for kernel bug that causes I/O errors on -EWOULDBLOCK
      I/O elevator failures (2.6 kernels only).

loop-AES-v2.2b    September 9 2004
    - Fixed queue->issue_flush_fn() bug that slipped to loop-AES-v2.2a and
      only affected barrier mounts on 2.6.9-rc and later kernels.

loop-AES-v2.2c    October 24 2004
    - Added compile time autodetection and workaround for per-thread vs.
      per-process rlimits (2.6 kernels).
    - Added Gentoo compatible binary key setup option to mount and losetup
      'mount -p 0 -o phash=unhashed3' or 'losetup -p 0 -H unhashed3'.
    - Added random key setup option to mount and losetup. This can be used
      to encrypt /tmp with random keys.
    - Added workaround for module_param_array() breakage in 2.6.10-rc

loop-AES-v2.2d    October 26 2004
    - Fixed mount so that it can set desired initial permissions for loop
      mounted encrypted file system root directory with random keys. This
      fix corrects README example 4 unwritable encrypted /tmp problem of
      loop-AES-v2.2c.

loop-AES-v3.0a    November 27 2004
    - Added new improved version 3 on-disk format that includes one separate
      key for MD5 IV computation. This fixes a weakness in IV computation
      that normally is not exploitable.
    - Fixed a bug that caused key file decrypt failure when gpg home
      directory was on read-only mounted file system. This bug affected
      encrypted root partition usage and is present only in losetup+mount
      from loop-AES-v2.2c and loop-AES-v2.2d versions.

loop-AES-v3.0b    January 16 2005
    - Fixed externally compiled module version multi-key-v3 ioctl
      incompatibility with boxes running 64 bit kernel and 32 bit userland.
      Kernel patch versions were not affected (2.4 and 2.6 kernels).
    - Fixed bug that made v3 on-disk format always use file backed code path
      on some 2.6 kernels that did not have LO_FLAGS_DO_BMAP defined. No
      data loss, but file backed code path is not journaled file system
      safe. Same bug also had cosmetic side effect of "losetup -a" status
      query always displaying file backed v2 on-disk format as v3 on-disk
      format.

loop-AES-v3.0c    March 18 2005
    - Changed gpg pipe code in losetup/mount to use '--no-options' instead
      of '--options /dev/null'. Fix from Lars Packschies.
    - Changed losetup/mount programs to warn about unknown key data format.
    - Added workaround for vanished QUEUE_FLAG_ORDERED define in
      2.6.11-rc3-mm1 kernel.
    - Changed gcc command line parameter order to be same as in kernel
      Makefile. Wrong parameter order caused miscompilation with Xen
      architecture (2.6 kernels).

loop-AES-v3.0d    June 18 2005
    - Added support for Red Hat installer specific LOOP_CHANGE_FD ioctl.
      Patch from David Eduardo Gomez Noguera. (2.6 kernels)
    - Added support for compat_ioctl. (2.6 kernels)
    - Changed build-initrd.sh script to accept both old and new style ldd
      program output.
    - gcc4 cleanups.

loop-AES-v3.1b    September 24 2005
    - Added block I/O priority support. (2.6 kernels)
    - Added VIA padlock hardware AES support. (2.4 and 2.6 kernels)
    - Added losetup -R option which recomputes size of loop device. Useful
      with loop device on top of LVM volume. Patch from Jim MacBaine. (2.4
      and 2.6 kernels)

loop-AES-v3.1c    January 18 2006
    - WBINVD assembler instruction is no longer used on Xen builds.
    - Makefile changed to probe .h header files instead of .c source files.
      (2.4 and 2.6 kernels)
    - compat_ioctl code updated to handle all 32bit/64bit loop ioctl
      conversions on 2.6 kernels. No longer depends on fs/compat_ioctl.c
      handling them.
    - Semaphores are not used/needed anymore on 2.6 kernels.
    - Makefile changed to work around 2.6.16-rc1 build breakage.

loop-AES-v3.1d    April 10 2006
    - Fixed Makefile incompatibility with USE_KBUILD=y build option.
    - Fixed incompatibility with CONFIG_PAX_KERNEXEC=y PAX config option.
    - Fixed incompatibility with old SuSE 8.0 kernel that caused scheduler
      interface to be misdetected.
    - Changed mount to honor offset=N and sizelimit=N mount options when
      they were used in combination with random keys generating phash=random
      mount option. Old encrypted data is used in new keys generation, but
      earlier buggy version always read and erased old data at offset=0.
    - Added mount patch from Max Vozeler that makes it easier to first fsck
      and then mount encrypted file systems.

loop-AES-v3.1e    October 28 2006
    - Changed swapon program to use getpagesize() instead of PAGE_SIZE
      macro. Fixes build failure on some architectures. Patch form Max
      Vozeler.
    - Fixed some confusing bits in README. Fix from Jens Lechtenboerger.
    - Work around vanished <linux/config.h> in 2.6.19-rc2 kernel. Fixes
      build failure.
    - Changed loop code to use kthread_create() instead of kernel_thread()
      on 2.6.19-rc and newer kernels.
    - Changed losetup and mount programs to output error message if gpg
      program does not exist when gpg encrypted key file is used.

loop-AES-v3.1f    February 23 2007
    - Work around dash /bin/sh shell and make-3.81 incompatibilities.
    - Work around block layer breakage in 2.6.20-rcX-mmX kernels.
    - Added "cleartextkey=file" mount option to mount, and "-P file" command
      line option to losetup. These options help automounters.
    - Added loop-aes-keygen script from Max Vozeler.

loop-AES-v3.2a    May 15 2007
    - loop_twofish.c loop_serpent.c loop_blowfish.c modules included. They
      are not built by default. Add EXTRA_CIPHERS=y make parameter to build
      them.
    - Makefile rewritten to always use kbuild method on 2.6 kernels.
    - Work around invalidate_bdev() changes on recent 2.6 kernels.

loop-AES-v3.2b    October 25 2007
    - Fixed compatibility detection problem involving separate obj/source
      trees.
    - Fixed request size problem on unencrypted device backed USB device.
    - Added initramfs type initrd build option to build-initrd.sh script.
      Patch from Fix <pr0gress0r@ngs.ru>.
    - Added gcc version override option to build-initrd.sh script.
    - Fixed losetup -P cleartext key option which always failed to work and
      printed error message saying so.
    - Added util-linux-ng patch.
    - Worked around block layer interface breakage on linux-2.6.24-rc1
      kernel.

loop-AES-v3.2c    March 6 2008
    - Fixed incompatibility with symlinks in /etc/fstab
    - Fixed incompatibility with 2.6.25-rc kernels.

loop-AES-v3.2d    October 28 2008
    - Worked around minix mkfs regression in build-initrd.sh script. Fix
      from Boris Wesslowski.
    - Added -f option to losetup. Patch from Max Vozeler.
    - Worked around block layer interface breakage on linux-2.6.28-rc
      kernels.

loop-AES-v3.2e    November 5 2008
    - Fix null pointer dereference when loop was used to mount iso9660
      CD-ROM image. This new bug was introduced in loop-AES-v3.2d, earlier
      versions are ok. Thanks to Peter Koek for reporting this issue.

loop-AES-v3.2f    March 25 2009
    - Work around kernel interface changes in 2.6.29-rc kernels
    - Maximum prealloc limit increased to 4096 pages.

loop-AES-v3.2g    June 26 2009
    - Fixed losetup -f bug in ancient util-linux-2.12r patch. This was
      actually a link goof that linked wrong version of a function. Newer
      util-linux-ng version was not affected. Bug reported by Phil Grundig.
    - Worked around block layer interface breakage on linux-2.6.31-rc1
      kernel.

loop-AES-v3.2h    October 11 2009
    - Worked around block layer interface breakage on linux-2.6.32-rc
      kernels.

loop-AES-v3.3a    March 16 2010
    - Fixed build-initrd.sh so that initramfs type initrd (USEPIVOT=2) works
      with linux software raid devices (/dev/md0 & co). Default pivot_root
      type initrd (USEPIVOT=1) was/is ok. Patch from Hauke Johannknecht.
    - build-initrd.sh now prefers to copy .static version of a program if
      such version exists. Patch from Hank Leininger.
    - Worked around block layer interface changes on linux-2.6.34-rc1
      kernel.
    - Fixed autodetection of optimized assembler code. autoconf.h file was
      moved in 2.6.33 kernel, which caused incorrect autodetected default.
    - Added support for new Intel AES instructions.

loop-AES-v3.4a    June 11 2010
    - Added faster (single thread) parallelized version Intel AES CBC
      encrypt, both 32 bit and 64 bit versions.
    - glue.c transfer functions re-write, better optimizations.
    - Added faster (single thread) parallelized version of MD5 for 64 bit
      amd64.
    - Requests sent to backing device have BIO_RW_NOIDLE bit set if loop
      driver believes that there won't be more requests anytime soon.

loop-AES-v3.4b    September 23 2010
    - Worked around block layer interface breakage on linux-2.6.36-rc
      kernels.
    - Added workaround for device open/close reference count race. This race
      caused random loop-AES "make tests" failures with "ioctl: LOOP_CLR_FD:
      Device or resource busy" error message. The workaround is in
      util-linux patch (new mount/umount/losetup/swapon binaries). Thanks to
      Julien Moutinho for reporting/testing this problem.

loop-AES-v3.5a    November 10 2010
    - Fixed device open/close reference count race, again. The fix in
      previous version was not complete enough. Thanks to John Fitzgerald
      for reporting/testing this problem.
    - Worked around block layer interface breakage on linux-2.6.37-rc
      kernels (FLUSH/FUA changes).
    - Cleaned up lots of #ifdef spaghetti code for 2.6.37 and later kernels.
    - Added "lo_threads" option for 2.6.37 and later kernels. This can be
      used to configure the number of helper threads for device backed loops.

loop-AES-v3.5b    November 11 2010
    - Fixed a race that could temporarily occour between two (or more) loop
      helper threads for same loop device. Two threads could interact with
      each other an not go to sleep when they should. This race wasted CPU
      cycles, but had no other ill effects.

loop-AES-v3.6a    January 24 2011
    - Worked around block layer interface breakage on 2.6.32.x, 2.6.36.x,
      and 2.6.37-rc kernels.
    - Queue code removal/rewrite for all 2.6.x kernels. This fixes a SMP
      race when more than one helper thread (per loop device) was used.
      Default was/is one helper thread. This race could leave backing device
      in "plugged" state when it should have been "unplugged". This race was
      introduced in loop-AES-v3.5a, and affected only 2.6.37 and later
      kernels.
    - Merged two loop kernel 2.6.x code bases back into one. This
      unfortunately re-introduces lots of #ifdef spaghetti.

loop-AES-v3.6b    February 26 2011
    - Fixed a bug that can cause "NULL pointer dereference" at /dev/md*
      backing device, and possibly other backing devices that call
      __bio_clone(). This bug is present in loop-AES-v3.6a (and
      loop-AES-v3.5 versions with linux-2.6.37 or later kernels).
    - Fixed a bug that can cause slow operation or even deadlock. This bug
      is present only in loop-AES-v3.6a version. Older versions are not
      affected.

loop-AES-v3.6c    April 29 2011
    - Worked around block layer interface breakage on 2.6.39-rc kernels.

loop-AES-v3.6d    July 8 2011
    - build-initrd.sh is now able to set up more than one loop device.
    - Fixed build on 3.x kernels.
    - Lots of #ifdef spaghetti removed for 3.x kernels.
    - Fixed build on recent RHEL kernels.

loop-AES-v3.6e    November 29 2011
    - Worked around block layer interface breakage on 3.2-rc kernels.

loop-AES-v3.6f    November 13 2012
    - Worked around block layer interface changes on 3.7-rc kernels.
    - Fixed bug that caused loop device to report un-optimal I/O size on
      some backing devices. This bug caused bad performance.
    - Fixed bug that assumed /bin/sh -> bash. For /bin/sh -> dash case some
      auto-detections failed.

loop-AES-v3.6g    November 25 2012
    - Fixed bug that could cause hang if backing device is stacking device,
      for example /dev/md* device. Many thanks to Norbert Warmuth for
      reporting and chasing this bug.

loop-AES-v3.6h    April 29 2013
    - Fixed bug that caused compile failure if kernel configuration has
      CONFIG_UIDGID_STRICT_TYPE_CHECKS=y. Patch from Hank Leininger.
    - Worked around block layer interface changes on 3.9 kernels.

loop-AES-v3.6i    July 1 2013
    - Worked around block layer interface changes on 3.10 kernels.
